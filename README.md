### introduction to the subject field and literature research
Data is everywhere, from Netflix to google maps, we use and make data daily without noticing. This data is what this minor is all about. it can be used to predict/classify all sorts of different subjects, from predicting the cheapest day refilling your car to classifying which plant is which based on the color/length of the petals. Personally, I classified wheelchair movements with my project group. Below is an introduction into this subject with scientific proof researched by me. 
     
Phones track steps and different sport activities, able bodied people have their movement info at their fingertips. Research from [badar ud din Tahir,S., etall.(2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9055944)shows that machine learning models are able to classify 12 different movements, walking forwards/walking left/ etc., correct with 73.33% accuracy. And a Study by [Zengtao Feng, etall.(2015)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7319532)  shows that people are still improving their training speed and test accuracy and stability for these movements through different predictive models.This second study also shows that random forest based models work better than more commonly used classifications and non-ensemble classifiers(KNN SVM BN J48). For wheelchair sports we see a slight research gap. Within wheelchair sports the research into classifying movements or sports in lacking. But in the paper from [R.M.Avan der Slikkeab, M.A.M.Berger, etall.,(2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021929015003231?via%3Dihub) research we can conclude wheelchair sport analysis is on the rise. Wheelchair kinematic analysis may be the first and crucial push this field needed to expand the knowledge of wheelchair movements. 
Further research into the project will be explained later in the portfolio.

## Research project
### Task definition 
Like I said before, abled persons have the ability to easily track and monitor their activities throughout the day. With only a phone you can already see your steps, activity time and calorie count. Most phones even have an app with which you can track your performance in trainings like running, swimming or cycling. We see a pattern here; all commonly available sports trackers are focused on steps. But wheelchairs roll you might say, yes, they do. But just like walking has a rhythm, so does riding. This would mean that wheelchair riding could also be monitored.

This is where our project comes into play, IMUâ€™s are used to track wheelchair movements in basketball games.  Our goal is to apply this data in machine learning models and extract selected wheelchair movements like sprints.  to reach this goal, the project group set up the following research question with some sub questions, to reach the end goal.

- How can IMU data be used to identify wheelchair basketball-specific movements?
  -	Which form of data processing will be used?
  -	Which specific movements can be detected?
  -	Which sensor data is used for each movement?
  -	Can movements be used to predict fatigue?
  -	Can movements be used to detect overload? These sub question will help us to get an answer to the main research question.

further research and supporting reasons for these questions can be found in the [plan of approach].

## Data procesing
  ### Data exploration 
    The student properly examined and visualized the data, distributions, outliers, correlations and used that analysis to give directions for an early hypothesis.
    in the early stages of the project i have looked at a lot of graphs. we would first look at fast breaks and fast defences. the movements could be split in two movements,
    rotations and sprints. within those graphs me and martijn came to the conclusion that there are two features that define a sprint. the first and most important feature
    for sprints is the wheelrotationalspeedX, this shows the wheelturning speed, it will show the push offs of the player. the second feature is the framerotationalspeedZ,
    this shows the turning speed of the wheelchair, it wil show if the wheelchair is moving in a straight line. 
  
  ### Data preperation 
  The student prepared the data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values, etc.

    preparing the dataset was my main focus. i looke at the data and searched for paterns in the different features we got from rienk.
    for this visualization a program was written that i studied and changed for usage. the first changes that were made was simplle multiplications. 
    this way the numbers were all around the same numbers. +- 500. after i started working with means, and low pass filters.
