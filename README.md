## reflection on own learning objectives


## evaluation on the group project as a whole


## Domain knowledge 
### introduction to the subject field and literature research
Data is everywhere, from Netflix to google maps, we use and make data daily without noticing. This data is what this minor is all about. it can be used to predict/classify all sorts of different subjects, from predicting the cheapest day refilling your car to classifying which plant is which based on the color/length of the petals. Personally, I classified wheelchair movements with my project group. Below is an introduction into this subject with scientific proof researched by me. 
     
Phones track steps and different sport activities, able bodied people have their movement info at their fingertips. Research from [badar ud din Tahir,S., etall.(2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9055944).

## Domain knowledge
  ### introduction of the subject field
  The student has written a good and complete introduction of the subject field.

  ### Literature research
  
  
  ### Explanation of Terminology, jargon and definitions
  
## Data procesing
  ### Data exploration 
    The student properly examined and visualized the data, distributions, outliers, correlations and used that analysis to give directions for an early hypothesis.
    in the early stages of the project i have looked at a lot of graphs. we would first look at fast breaks and fast defences. the movements could be split in two movements,
    rotations and sprints. within those graphs me and martijn came to the conclusion that there are two features that define a sprint. the first and most important feature
    for sprints is the wheelrotationalspeedX, this shows the wheelturning speed, it will show the push offs of the player. the second feature is the framerotationalspeedZ,
    this shows the turning speed of the wheelchair, it wil show if the wheelchair is moving in a straight line. 
  
  ### Data preperation 
  The student prepared the data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values, etc.

    preparing the dataset was my main focus. i looke at the data and searched for paterns in the different features we got from rienk.
    for this visualization a program was written that i studied and changed for usage. the first changes that were made was simplle multiplications. 
    this way the numbers were all around the same numbers. +- 500. after i started working with means, and low pass filters.
